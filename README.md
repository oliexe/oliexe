Hi, I’m Ondrej Rehacek, software engineer and indie game developer with a strong passion for creating cutting-edge digital solutions. I'm based in Czech Republic, but usually traveling all around the world.

Currently, I’m a part of a founding team at Stash.gg, a gaming commerce startup based in United States founded by Twitch co-founder Justin Kan. I'm leading development of developer tooling and helping game developers integrate Stash services.

I also run a small independent indie studio Coalworks, currently working on a yet unannounced game for mobile and Nintendo Switch.
